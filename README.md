Create a new repository for this project called VBA-challenge. Do not add this assignment to an existing repository.

Inside the new repository that you just created, add any VBA files that you use for this assignment. These will be the main scripts to run for each analysis.

Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

1. The ticker symbol

2. Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

3. The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

4. The total stock volume of the stock. 

5. Process of finding solutions should follow the following images:

Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once.

Use the sheet alphabetical_testing.xlsx while developing your code. This dataset is smaller and will allow you to test faster. Your code should run on this file in under 3 to 5 minutes.

Make sure that the script acts the same on every sheet. The joy of VBA is that it takes the tediousness out of repetitive tasks with the click of a button.
